PXM -> contains pixel data encoded as characters
PXM -> designed for the X Windows System

ðŸ§± Structure Example

A small .xpm file might look like this:

/* XPM */
static char * example[] = {
"4 4 2 1",
". c #FFFFFF",
"# c #000000",
"....",
".##.",
".##.",
"...."
};

What This Means:

    4 4 2 1: width, height, number of colors, chars per pixel

    ". c #FFFFFF": . represents white

    "# c #000000": # represents black

    The last 4 lines are the actual pixel rows of the image
